# Supply Chain Forecasting and Optimization Module

## Description


This project, implemented in a Jupyter Notebook (`.ipynb`), provides Python classes for two common supply chain techniques:
1.  **Moving Average Forecasting:** A simple time-series forecasting method implemented from scratch using NumPy.
2.  **Transportation Linear Programming (LP):** An optimization model to find the minimum cost shipment plan between supply sources and demand destinations, using the PuLP library.

This notebook demonstrates the application of these quantitative methods in a scalable and reusable format, including example usage for both techniques.

## Requirements

To run this notebook, you need a Jupyter environment and the following Python libraries:
* Python 3.x
* Jupyter Notebook or Jupyter Lab
* PuLP library
* NumPy library

You can install the required Python libraries using pip (the notebook also includes a cell to install them):
```bash
pip install jupyterlab pulp numpy
```

(Or pip install notebook pulp numpy, if you prefer the classic Notebook interface)

How to Run:-

Clone or Download: Clone this repository or download the supply_chain_project.ipynb file.

Start Jupyter: Open your terminal or command prompt, navigate to the directory where you saved the file, and start Jupyter Lab (jupyter lab) or Jupyter Notebook (jupyter notebook).

Open Notebook: Your browser should open the Jupyter interface. Navigate to and open the supply_chain_project.ipynb file.

Run Cells: You can run the cells

The script includes example usage for both the MovingAverageForecaster and TransportationOptimizer classes
